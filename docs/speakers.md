| **Talk Title TBD** |
| Talk Abstract TBD |

| **Affiliation** | [University of Michigan](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/) |
| **Biography** | Stella X. Yu is a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, where she focuses on research in computer vision and machine learning. Prior to joining the University of Michigan, she was the Director of the Vision Group at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley and held various academic roles at UC Berkeley, including positions in computer science, vision science, and cognitive sciences. Stella earned her Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, where she specialized in robotics and vision science. Her research explores visual perception through multiple lenses of representation learning aiming to develop models that can exceed human capabilities. She is particularly focused on actionable representation learning and structure-aware models, emphasizing that structure in visual data should naturally emerge or be reflected in the model structures.
