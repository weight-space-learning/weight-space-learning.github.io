# Overview

| **Date** | One-day workshop on Sunday April 27th *or* Monday April 28th, 2025 |
| **Location** | The workshop will be held in person in Singapore. Remote access will be made available at a later date. |


The recent surge in the number of publicly available neural network models—exceeding a million on platforms like Hugging Face—calls for a shift in how we perceive neural network weights. This workshop aims to establish neural network weights as a new data modality, offering immense potential across various fields.

We plan to address key dimensions of **weight space learning:**

- **Weight Space as a Modality**: Characterization of the weight space, <br> symmetries, scaling laws, and model zoo datasets.
- **Model analysis**: Inferring model properties, such as test performance <br> or generalization error, by the inspection of their weights.
- **Model synthesis**: Generating model weights for specific datasets and tasks, <br> and improving tasks like pruning, merging, and robustness through weight manipulation.
- **Learning from populations**: Using data from neural network populations to identify <br> and exploit structure in trained models.
- **Applications to neural fields and beyond**: Applying weight space learning to 3D shape analysis, neural radiance fields (NeRFs), and other domains.

Weight space learning remains a nascent and scattered research area. Our goal is to provide a bridge between the abovementioned topics, and research areas such as model merging, neural architecture search, and meta-learning. By aligning terminology and methodologies, we aim to drive sustained progress and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Research Goals and Key Questions

This workshop will explore fundamental questions about weight spaces, such as:

- What properties of weights, such as symmetries and invariances, present challenges or can be leveraged for optimization, learning and generalization?
- How can model weights be efficiently represented, manipulated, and used for downstream tasks?
- What model information can be decoded from model weights?
- Can model weights be generated for specific applications, to make training and model selection more efficient?
- Can weight space learning benefit research in processing and synthesising neural fields, for e.g. scientific applications and 3D vision?
- How can we democratize the usage of weight spaces, enabling more efficient research progress?

## Accessibility and Modality

All accepted papers and posters will be available online for remote attendees. The talks will be recorded and made available on YouTube. We will also have a dedicated Discord channel for virtual engagement, ensuring that participants, whether in-person or remote, can collaborate and discuss ideas.
